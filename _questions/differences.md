title: What are the differences between using the services of a contractor company, design firm, independent designer, and archiparti?
---
Differences are just evident.

* Contractor company is depressing.
* There are vampires in design firm.
* Independent designer is far too hot.
* Just to be fair, archiparti is pretty.

(Weâ€™re only kidding.)

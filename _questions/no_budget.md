title: I love the design but don’t have the budget. What can I do?
---
If you love the design and don‘t have money, do the following steps:

1. Print a large picture of design you loved on the best color printer available in your city. Put it on your wall.
Look at this picture every day.
2. Write the love letter to the designer. (That should be anonymous love letter!)
3. Cry.
4. Earn enough money, and buy that lovely design, at last!
6. ???
7. Profit!
